# Code Test: Movement Component System Prototype

Build a standalone prototype that demonstrates the core Movement component system architecture.

## What You're Building

A simple web app that:
1. Lets users write Vue components in a CodeMirror editor
2. Compiles them using WebContainers
3. Extracts props automatically
4. Renders the component with a props UI
5. Provides the $mvt global runtime

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- A modern browser (Chrome/Edge recommended for WebContainer support)

### Setup (2 minutes)

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:3000`

**Important:** WebContainers require special CORS headers which are configured in `vite.config.js`. The dev server must be running for the app to work properly.

## Your Task

This is a Vue 3 application. Complete the TODOs in the following files:

### `src/App.vue`
1. **TODO 1**: Initialize WebContainer and compile Vue SFC when the user clicks "Compile Component"
2. **TODO 2**: Extract props from the Vue component and convert to JSON Schema format
   - Parse the Vue component's `props` definition
   - Convert Vue types (String, Number) to JSON Schema types (string, number)
   - Extract `default` values and `mvt.description` into the schema
   - Map `mvt.min`/`mvt.max` to `minimum`/`maximum` for number types
   - Return a proper JSON Schema object (see [JSON Schema spec](https://json-schema.org/))
   - The schema will automatically display in the right panel
3. **TODO 4**: Mount the compiled component in the preview panel

### `src/runtime.js`
4. **TODO 5**: Implement the `$mvt.store` methods (localStorage is recommended)

A sample Vue component is provided in the CodeMirror editor to help you get started. It includes props with custom `mvt` metadata that should be extracted. The app structure and reactive data bindings are already set up - you just need to implement the compilation, extraction, and mounting logic.
